# Tache.io
## The Transformation Cache server.

Tache.io is an on-demand web data munger. It is a NodeJS-powered, Redis-backed server for applying transformations on remote content, with cached results.

Tache.io enables remote clients (e.g. mobile apps) to receive Web resource in an altered fashion, without having to repeatedly munge data at the client end or alter the original web resources. It shoulders the burden of transforming data into lightweight representations and provides mass-availability, while keeping the original publishing server happily untouched and allowing for simple client processing.

## Overview

All client-facing functionality in Tache.io is grouped into *endpoints* that you write for specific purposes.

Simply make an HTTP `GET` request to your endpoint's name followed by the URL of the resource you want to transform., e.g. `GET /my-endpoint/http://example.com`. The URL given can be any resource that the Tache.io server can retrieve over HTTP -- this could be content on the public web, resources inside your network, etc.

Endpoints are given the remote content that the end-user specified, then transform it and emit a response.

Some examples of actions that your endpoints could perform:

* Resize/compress images
* Scrape webpages to core-content form, Ã  la [Readability](http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/)
* Convert verbose resources & formats into lightweight over-the-wire formats
    * e.g. get just what you need from a large XML resource as a small JSON document

You can also specify the endpoint as an additional header named `Tache-endpoint`, and omit it from the request URL, e.g.

    GET /http://example.com
    Tache-endpoint: my-endpoint

Tache.io will fetch the request specified by the URL, pass it through each transformation job in turn, and output the result to the client. It'll also store a cache of the result on the server, ready for quick retrieval later.

## How to write endpoints

For compatibility with the [Node require() stack](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.5/api/modules.html#modules) and with NPM, endpoints are stores in a project's `node_modules` directory. They should have the same filename, or module name as you want to use in the URL when calling them.

For example, if you want to provide an endpoint that is accessed at `http://myserver/munge/http://example.com` you can either add a single file called `munge.js` in `node_modules`, or add a directory called `munge` containing a package.json file, or anything else that can be read by `require()`.

Endpoint functions receive two parameters; the headers from the remote resource in question, and the body of the remote resource.

Endpoints are expected to export at least one function `do`. This is considered the default endpoint function, when you call the endpoint just by its name.

You can export multiple functions, which are then accessible by specifying the function name in the request, in the form `endpoint_name.func-name`.

For example, given the following code in `node_modules/echo.js`:

    // echo the remote content unmodified
    module.exports.do = function(headers, content) {
        this.emit('done', content);
    }
    
    //echo the remote content with some corrections
    module.exports.fix = function(headers, content) {
        this.emit('done',
            content.replace(/\b([tT])eh\b/gi, '$1he')
        );
    }

Then a request to `http://myserver/echo/http://www.example.com` will simply return http://www.example.com's body content. A request to `http://myserver/echo.fix/http://www.example.com` will return it with any instances of 'teh' corrected to 'the'.

## Usage

Make sure you have all the prerequisites:

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/) (tested on 0.4.0 +)
* [npm](http://npmjs.org/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)

Clone this repository to somewhere on your machine

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/orls/tache.io.git
    cd tache.io/

Link the tache.io package (note: this will not be required soon, once tache is released as a proper npm package)

    npm link tache.io/

Run tache:

    node tache-bootstrap.js

This will start Tache.io with default configuration: it will listen for requests on localhost:8000 and look for a redis server on 127.0.0.1:6379.

## Current status

Feel free to fork this project and help me build it. Suggestions and comments are always welcome; just add a feature request issue at https://github.com/orls/tache.io/issues

## Building and testing

Testing is performed with the excellent [Expresso](http://visionmedia.github.com/expresso/)

    npm install expresso
    cd tache.io/
    expresso

## Related projects

* [Node.io](http://node.io/) has some similar goals -- simple-to-write content transformations -- but a very different architecture focused less on remote resources.
* Tache was conceived around the same time as [tip.js -- Translucent Intercepting Proxy](http://blog.lagentz.com/nodejs/translucent-intercepting-proxy-built-with-nodejs-tip-js/) and shares some of the goals and concepts.

## Some thoughts and notes

### Roadmap and desireables

* Plugin/modular cache support (to encourage other cache backends)
* Other request styles, e.g. `?url=` param
* Endpoint status/meta responses
* HTTP authentication
* SSL w/client certificate authentication
* Management interface
    * Enable/disable endpoints
    * Aliases to endpoints?
        * take better advantage of the connect middleware
    * credentials mgmt
    * Total cache sizes
    * time to live
    * selective cache cleardown tools
* Optionally log events to remote analytics services.
* Possibly operate in a 'fuller' proxy mode (more transparent)
